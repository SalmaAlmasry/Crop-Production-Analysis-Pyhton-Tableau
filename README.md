# Crop-Production-Analysis-Pyhton-Tableau üåæ
Analyzing the Crop Production, importing and exporting around the world, introducing answers through tableau dashboards and stories.

## Overview
The project provides a comprehensive understanding of crop production dynamics, performance, and trends. it empowers import and export companies with valuable insights for decision-making, market exploration, and identifying growth opportunities.

## But here is some details
By leveraging open agricultural data sources, I gathered extensive information on crop yields, production quantities, and cultivation practices across various countries and regions.

**The main two sources of data was:**
1) World Bank: https://lnkd.in/d6Q4pbE5
2) Kaggle: https://lnkd.in/dRrp5eaa

Then, with Python, I processed and cleaned the data, performed statistical analysis, and uncovered valuable insights. I applied data visualization techniques to present the findings in a clear and compelling manner.

**The project delved into multiple aspects, including:**

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Crop production index by country and year.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Countries outperforming the base period.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Countries experiencing declining production.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Changes in crop production and area harvested.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation between "Area Harvested" and production.
    6Ô∏è‚É£ Identification of crop outliers.
    7Ô∏è‚É£ Countries with crop variety.
    8Ô∏è‚É£ Countries contributing to 80% of production.
    9Ô∏è‚É£ Top products for specific countries and years.

üìä To showcase the results, I created captivating visualizations using Tableau. The interactive dashboards and charts allows stakeholders to explore the data, uncover trends, and gain a comprehensive understanding of the global crop production landscape.
